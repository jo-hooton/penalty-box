This app can be used to manage a penalty box in a game of roller derby. A penalty box can have up to six skaters in at one time, two of which can be jammers (point scorers) and 4 can be blockers. 

One penalty is 30 seconds long, unless you are a jammer entering the box after the opposing teams jammer, then your penalty is as long as the time the other jammer served. In the case that the jammer already in the box has multiple penalties, a new jammer serves as long as the other jammer has on their last penalty.
